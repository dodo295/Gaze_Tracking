# Gaze_Tracking
Real time eye tracking using OpenCV and haarcascades

# Objective 

--> This project uses Open CV cascading classifiers and established databases to detect face and eye. 

--> It will intentionally track the gaze of only one face. 

--> From the bounding box, an algorithm that detects the group of contours closest to the center.
 
--> Then, it produces an approximation of the pupil and is marked with an orange point.

# Steps

--> The first step is to download the required packages. Installation via pip:
pip install opencv-python

--> The second step is to classify, you need a classifer. There are haarcascades available face ('haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml') and eye ('haarcascade_eye.xml') stickers that come with the OpenCV library, and you can download them from the official github repository:'https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades'

--> The third step is to run code from this command: 'python3 Gaze Tracking.py'
